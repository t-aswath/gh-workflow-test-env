## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks

### Problem Statement:

A stock trader is analyzing an array `prices`, where `prices[i]` represents the price of a given stock on the **i-th** day.

The trader wants to **maximize their profit** by choosing **a single day to buy** one stock and **a different future day to sell** it.

However, to qualify for a special trading **bonus**, the profit made must be **divisible by k** (i.e., `profit % k == 0`).

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve a profit that is **divisible by k**, otherwise return `false`.

---

### Input Format:

- An integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of the stock on the `i-th` day.
- An integer `k` representing the required divisibility condition.

---

### Output Format:

- Return `true` if there exists a valid `(buy, sell)` pair where the profit is divisible by `k`, otherwise return `false`.

---

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
**Input:**  
```plaintext
prices = [3, 9, 2, 8, 15], k = 3
```
**Output:**  
```plaintext
false
```
**Explanation:**  
- Buy at price `2` on day `2`, sell at price `15` on day `4`.  
- Profit = `15 - 2 = 13`, which is not divisible by `3`.  
- Since `13 % 3 != 0`, return `false`.

---

#### Example 2:
**Input:**  
```plaintext
prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11], k = 5
```
**Output:**  
```plaintext
false
```
**Explanation:**  
- The maximum possible profit is `11 - 5 = 6`.  
- `6` is not divisible by `5`, so return `false`.

---

### Constraints:

1. \( 2 \leq \text{prices.length} \leq 10^5 \)
2. \( 1 \leq \text{prices}[i] \leq 10^9 \)
3. \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^6 \)
